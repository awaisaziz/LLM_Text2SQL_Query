# Text-to-SQL Evaluation Framework (baseline)

This folder contains implementations and outputs for multiple Text-to-SQL used for baselines, including **DIA-SQL**, and **DIN-SQL** models. Each model translates natural language questions into executable SQL queries and is evaluated on standard datasets such as **Spider 1.0**.
